              This devlog is going to be focused on speed ðŸš€. I'm going to show
              various ways we've <br />
              made Ghostty really, really, fast in recent weeks. There are many
              ways to measure the <br />
              speed of a terminal emulator. Perhaps in another blog post I'll
              define each of the ways, <br />
              but today I will simply state that the performance work showcased
              in this devlog will <br />
              all revolve around IO throughput.
              <br />
              <br />
              IO throughput is the speed that the program running within the
              terminal emulator <br />
              (the shell, neovim, tmux, cat, etc.) can pump bytes to the
              terminal emulator and have <br />
              them processed. This particular metric has a very real world
              impact, from tailing very <br />
              loud log output to accidentally dumping a large file to the
              terminal (we've all <br />
              been there).

              Improving Plain Text Throughput with SIMD (#1472) <br />
              <br />
              A program uses a single stream (a "pty") to communicate to the
              terminal emulator.
              <br />
              This stream can contain either plain text or control characters.{" "}
              <br />
              <br />
              Plain text prints directly to the terminal and is sent as-is. For
              example, to write "Hello, <br />
              World!" to the terminal, the program writes Hello World! UTF-8
              encoded1 to the pty. <br />
              <br />
              Control characters are used to do things such as set style
              attributes (foreground color, <br />
              underline, bold, etc.), move the cursor, delete lines, change the
              keyboard protocol, etc. <br />
              Control characters have various formats but one thing almost all
              of them2 have in <br />
              common is they start with the escape character (hex 0x1B). <br />A
              naive, but typical approach is to read the bytes in a for loop:{" "}
              <br />

              <div
                className="border body"
                style={{
                  backgroundColor: "#0e121a",
                  padding: "25px",
                  width: "700px",
                  height: "200px",

              <br />
              This looks at one byte at a time. But computers since the late 90s
              have been able <br />
              to perform operations on multiple bytes at a time using SIMD
              instructions ("Single <br />
              Instruction Multiple Data"). According to Valve's latest Steam
              Hardware Survey, over <br />
              99% of active computers support the ability to look at 16 to 32
              bytes in one CPU <br />
              instruction. <br />
              <br />
              We often rely on compilers to optimize our code for us so we don't
              have to think about <br />
              the minutia of individual CPU instructions. Unfortunately,
              compilers are notoriously <br />
              bad at autovectorization and with the exception of relatively
              trivial loops, compilers <br />
              rarely autovectorize effectively. SIMD is a rare scenario where
              hand-writing assembly <br />
              (or near it) often results in significantly better performance
              over a state of the art <br />
              optimizing compiler. The SIMD approach to finding control
              sequences above looks like this:

              Assume in the above two examples that the comparison operation
              takes exactly the <br />
              same amount of time. The SIMD example would process the bytes 16x
              faster. Reality is <br />
              not quite so simple, but you can get staggering speedups through
              SIMD.
              <br />
              <br />
              To further complicate things, SIMD instruction sets vary by CPU
              generation. If you're <br />
              distributing a binary form of your program and want to take
              advantage of the best <br />
              features available, you must write a variation for each SIMD
              instruction set, compile <br />
              each form, and choose the correct version at runtime using CPU
              feature detection (i.e. <br />
              using the cpuid instruction on x86).
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, the code above says "chunk of 16 bytes." Well,
              depending on the <br />
              hardware, that might be 16 bytes (aarch64 neon instruction set
              such as on Apple <br />
              Silicon), 32 bytes for AVX2, 64 bytes for AVX512, etc. And its not
              just the size that <br />
              varies, the literal CPU instructions (binary code) varies.
              Therefore, you must write or <br />
              compile the code multiple times.

              <br />
              Ghostty now uses SIMD to execute roughly the second code sample
              above. <br />
              Additionally, we use SIMD to also decode UTF-83 multiple bytes at
              a time. On Apple <br />
              Silicon (M3 Max), Ghostty now processes ASCII input 7.3x faster:
